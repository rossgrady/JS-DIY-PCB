controls board for the DIY edition of the hexinverter Jupiter Storm

The DIY edition of the Hexinverter Jupiter Storm has a single board & a front panel, leaving it to the individual builder to decide how to mount & wire the pots & jacks, and to attach the board to the panel.

Most people panel-mount all the hardware and rig up some kind of bracket for the board. I hate panel-mounting a lot of pots and jacks, and I didn't want to drill holes for brackets in the panel, so I laid out a PCB for all of the jacks, switches & pots.

The holes in 2 of the corners correspond to the corner holes in the main JS PCB. There's one set of pads on the side of this PCB that corresponds to a set of pads on the side of the main JS PCB -- they can be directly connected w/right-angle headers as one mounting option. If you do that, secure the corner holes together with some kind of right-angle bracket (or wire ties).
